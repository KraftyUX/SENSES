**Prompty SENSES** is an open-source Python algorithm for evaluating AI prompt quality using metaphorical sensory scores (HSSTT: Hear, See, Smell, Touch, Taste). It aggregates user ratings and feedback to compute a composite quality metric, with robust outlier removal and normalization.

## Features

- **Hear**: Measures response coherence and logical flow.
- **See**: Evaluates structural clarity and organization.
- **Smell**: Detects novelty through deviation patterns.
- **Touch**: Assesses practical usability via success rates.
- **Taste**: Quantifies subjective preference and satisfaction.
- **Customizable**: Adjust the Z-score threshold for outlier removal.
- **Extensible**: Add your own metrics or sensory dimensions.
- **Robust**: Handles edge cases, large datasets, and invalid inputs gracefully.
